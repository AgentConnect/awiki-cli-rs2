# Changelog

## 0.1.3

- Add the native API v2 external HTTP ANP authentication facade.
- Add opaque single-use request attempts, origin-scoped in-memory Bearer reuse,
  response token capture, and one bounded `401` signature retry.
- Add an explicit test-only literal-loopback HTTP option; production targets
  remain HTTPS-only.
